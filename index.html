<p>Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter, known mononymously as Beyoncé, is an American singer, songwriter, actress, and businesswoman, born in Houston, Texas, on September 4, 1981. She rose to fame as the lead singer of the R&B group Destiny's Child in the late 1990s before launching a highly successful solo career with her 2003 debut album, Dangerously in Love. Beyoncé holds the record for the most Grammy Awards won by any artist, with 35 wins
    Beyoncé was born Beyoncé Giselle Knowles to Tina (née Beyoncé) and Mathew Knowles (divorced 2011). She has a younger sister, Solange, who also became a successful recording artist. At age nine Beyoncé formed the singing-rapping girl group Destiny’s Child (originally called Girl’s Tyme) in 1990 with childhood friends. In 1992 the group lost on the Star Search television talent show, and three years later it was dropped from a recording contract before an album had been released. In 1997 Destiny’s Child’s fortunes reversed with a Columbia recording contract and then an eponymous debut album that yielded the hit single “No, No, No Part 2.” Its follow-up album, The Writing’s on the Wall (1999), earned the group two Grammy Awards and sold more than eight million copies in the United States. Survivor (2001), the group’s third album, reached the number one spot on the Billboard 200 chart. By this time the group’s lineup, which had seen several personnel changes, was composed of Beyoncé, Kelly Rowland, and Michelle Williams.
